# Reflection
Through this course, I have learned the fundamental of programming technique in C++. The topic learned includes array, pointer, structure and many more. I also become more familiar with C++ programming technique through many lab exercises and tutorials.  I could now apply the theory learned in solving problems.                                    
Other than that, I hope I could master what I have learned and applied it in the future also. I think the course could improve by including more interesting elements in the teaching.
